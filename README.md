# SWACD Local KCP Demo

This repository contains a **fully working local KCP (Kubernetes Control Plane)** setup for the **SWACD (Secure Web Application Control Delivery)** project.  
It demonstrates the end-to-end flow of defining Custom Resources (CRDs), applying sample CRs, and running a lightweight controller that reconciles them.
